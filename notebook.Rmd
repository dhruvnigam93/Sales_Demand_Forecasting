## Exploratory data analysis

```{r}
train_data = read.csv("train.csv" , stringsAsFactors = F)
head(train_data)
```

No NA values - the heavens have ssmiled upon us - it is quite rare to find data like this.  However the store and item numbers are being read as numeric variable instead of factor variables - we need to fix that.
```{r}
train_data$store = as.character(train_data$store)
train_data$item = as.character(train_data$item)
train_data$date = as.Date(train_data$date)
table(train_data[c("store", "item")])

```

Again very consistent data - all stores have observations for all items 

```{r}

train_data %>%
  mutate(month = as.yearmon(date)) %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise( total_sales = sum(sales) ) %>%
  ggplot() +geom_line(aes(x = month , y = total_sales))

```
